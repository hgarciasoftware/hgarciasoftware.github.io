		<p>I don't usually talk about myself; I don't really like to. The hardest part of this assignment for me is finding a creative use for a <code>&lt;table&gt;</code>. The second hardest part is figuring out what to say.</p>
        <p>I live in the South Bronx, New York. I've lived in New York for most of my life. I'm <span class="age"></span>* years old.</p>

		  <p id="caption">I used to live on Rogers Place, which has a mural dedicated to the rapper Big Pun, like the one above. This is not the same mural but it's the only other image I found besides <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/maureen_barlin/23898450060" target="_blank">one from London</a> that was free to use.</p>
