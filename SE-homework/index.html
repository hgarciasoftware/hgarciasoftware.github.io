	    <h3>Welcome to my GitHub!</h3>
	    <p>Just like how we all have our own way of writing and speaking, we all have our own creative styles of programming that evolve as we, also, evolve. I'm interested not just in learning the Art of Computer Programming but also learning to value Computer Programming as Art.</p>
	    <p>In the past, I worked professionally as a web developer. Before that, I taught myself how to program for the web. Now, I'm looking to refine and build on my skills as a software engineer.</p>
	    <p>I look forward to learning both from and with all of you and hopefully you can learn something from me.</p>
